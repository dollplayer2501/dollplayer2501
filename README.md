As of the end of February 2025, I am focusing on setting up the environment on [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) with [Qtile](https://qtile.org/).  

<a href="https://github.com/dollplayer2501/project2501-v3"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dollplayer2501/project2501-v3/refs/heads/main/source/images/screenshot..project2501-v3-dark..thumb.png" width=200></a> <a href="https://github.com/dollplayer2501/Eleventy-netlify-V2"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dollplayer2501/project2501-v3/main/source/images/screenshot..Eleventy-netlify-V2..main..thumb.png" width="200"></a>

For this reason, website production using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is currently on hold.  
Currently, the environment settings on EndeavourOS are finally complete.  
Separately from that, I would also like to increase my writing on **[Zenn](https://zenn.dev/dollplayer2501)** if possible.  


## What kind of environment do you work in?

- **PC/Hardware**  
ThinkPad X13 Gen 1 (AMD), RAM 16GB
- **OS**  
EndeavourOS, Endeavour Neo
- **DE/WM**  
Qtile on Xfce4
- **Shell, etc.**

Apart from this, I also have a Windows desktop machine, which I use for other things besides SNS, such as browsing video sites.
